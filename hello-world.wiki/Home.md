## Welcome to the Mail Automation Project!

The Mailbot Automation Pilot Team have been working on an email automation system that has been developed as a virtual assistant that will handle incoming emails, log them in the customer record management system and either resolve the query with a suitable response or redirect the enquiry to someone who can review and respond.

The virtual assistant has been set up to answer frequently ask questions that West and North Northants Customer Services Team receive. This includes re-direction to online services available on the authority website, as well as re direction to other sovereign authority websites, partners and organisations.

This removes the need for a customer services agent to resolve simple queries requiring an almost “pre-packaged” response and enables the customer to get an almost simultaneous reply, freeing up agents to spend their time on resolving more complex issues that the virtual assistant can’t currently handle.
