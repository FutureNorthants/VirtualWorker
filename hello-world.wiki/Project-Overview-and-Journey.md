Since April 2020 West Northants Future Northants, Customer Services and Digital Team have been working on the Mail Automation Project for West and North Northamptonshire Council.

Since launch of this project, the team have been able to build a proof on concept within the former Northampton Borough Council Customer Services Team, now known as West Northants. This proof of concept was produced in readiness for unitary on development of a mail automation system.

A full video of the proof of concept can be watched here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kmo-ybzJm0&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kmo-ybzJm0&)

The mail automation pilot has proven we can automate the process of email and ‘contact us’ forms using AI technology. 

After success of proof of concept the Mail Automation Project team deployed the Unitary MailBot which enables customers to access the multitude of services we offer across the districts/sovereign.


## Milestones:

**December 2019** the Mail Automation proof on concept was presented at a Digital Demo held by Future Northants Programme Team

**March 2020** the business case to pursue the trial was approved in March 2020

**May 2020** the Project Initiation Document (PID) was approved and work began outlining user requirements, process flows and specifications were mapped.

**June 2020** [Sprint 1](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%201) began and first part of Norberts functionality was built enabling Norbert to successfully receive customer contact, distribute within the authorities customer record management system, Jadu CXM, and mark the query for agent action. Norbert also learnt the ability to respond frequently asked questions asked by our customers through email.

**July 2020** [Sprint 2](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%202) and [Sprint 3](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%203) were completed and internal testing and feedback sessions took place at the end of July from CSA staff across the county on the functionality built so far

**August 2020** [Sprint 4](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%204) was set over 4 weeks. Feedback on the process was taken from the CSA and Change Champions and refinements were made accordingly. Development also underwent to enable Norbert to respond to customer contact when received through an online enquiry form.

**October 2020** [Sprint 6](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%206) was spaced over a 4 week period, this mainly consisted of further enhancements and bug fixes. One main focus of this sprint was the ability for Norbert to transfer email attachments that were supporting documents, towards housing application - to one readable PDF File. Also referred to as _The Bundler_. This feature was created to reduce handle time on upload of housing application documents. Ajustments were made to Norberts confidence threshold, previously set to 100%, reduced to 90%. This enabled Norbert to start helping the General Public for the first time, and answering their enquiries directly. 

**November 2020** Norbert took over the management of Housing Customer Services emails, however further refinements were required as the process was not working as expected. A divert was created on the documents@northampton.digital email address (the new email created to manage documents) to "reverse" the tech and allow document emails to continually flow through until further development is made on _The Bundler_. In [Spint 7](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%207)the team focused on the scope and initial development to give Norbert the ability to assist with the distribution customer contact, across the 8 unified districts and boroughs within West and North Northamptonshire.

**December 2020 to April 2021** consisted on Sprints [8](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%208), [9](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%209) and [10](https://dev.azure.com/WNU-DevOps/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/_sprints/taskboard/West%20Northants%20Mailbot%20Team/Mail%20Automation%20Pilot%20NBC/West%20Northants%20Mailbot/Sprint%2010). Within these Sprints the team were able to improve Norberts abilities and knowledge further enabling him to automatically forward emails to the appropriate sovereign service or department across 8 all councils within West and North Northamptonshire. The team also re-built this technology within North Northamptonshire.


**March 2021** [Sprint 11](https://github.com/FutureNorthants/VirtualWorker/projects/2) continued and was the final sprint before _go live_ of the Mail Automation System for West and North Northamptonshire Council. Final adjustments were made, and "quick fixes" were put in place with Norberts ability to manage contact us forms on the West and North Northamptonshire Website. Quick development was created to assist the distribution of contact received within Angel Square in alignment with the Data Sharing Agreement. Late on the _31st March 2021_ Norberts enhancements for the Unitary Email Distribution and Management was Deployed. 


**April 2021** [Sprint 12](https://github.com/FutureNorthants/VirtualWorker/projects/3) consisted of bugs fixes and enhancements to previous "quick fixes". Feedback was gathered from the CSA's and service leads on how Norbert was managing the distribution of customer contact. This helped align the priorities within Sprint 12. 

**May 2021** - [Sprint 13](https://github.com/FutureNorthants/VirtualWorker/projects/4) held priorities that were not achieved within the time scale of [Sprint 12](https://github.com/FutureNorthants/VirtualWorker/projects/3) as well as further enhancements to help increase Norberts ability to correctly distribute customer contact. Norbert also gained the ability to attach customer emails for the sovereign forwardees and the knowledge to distribuste customer contact based on "area".
